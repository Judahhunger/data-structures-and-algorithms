- [x] Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
- [x] Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments.

- [x] Take a photo of your completed whiteboard, matching the example whiteboard layout.
- [x] Copy your photo into an /assets directory in your repo
- [x] Give the image file the same name as the branch you are working on
- [x] Embed the image in your README.md documentation
- [x] Create a pull request from your branch to your master branch
- [x] In your open pull request, leave as a comment a checklist of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
- [x] Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment
- [x] Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box
